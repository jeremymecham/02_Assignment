        <p>George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, in Westmoreland County, Virginia, into a family of modest means. His father, Augustine Washington, was a prosperous planter, and his mother, Mary Ball Washington, played a significant role in his upbringing after his father’s death when George was just 11 years old. Though Washington had little formal education, he developed practical skills, particularly as a surveyor, which helped him gain an early understanding of the American wilderness and colonial lands.</p>

        <h2>Early Military Career</h2>
        <p>In his early twenties, Washington began his military career by joining the Virginia militia. He served during the French and Indian War (1754-1763), where he distinguished himself as a capable leader and tactician. Despite facing setbacks, such as a notable defeat at Fort Necessity, these experiences proved invaluable in shaping his military and leadership abilities, laying the groundwork for his future role as a key figure in the American Revolution.</p>

        <p>After the war, Washington returned to civilian life at Mount Vernon, the large estate in Virginia he inherited from his half-brother, Lawrence. In 1759, he married Martha Custis, a wealthy widow with two children. Washington managed Mount Vernon, improving agricultural practices and expanding his wealth, becoming one of the leading planters in Virginia. Though he preferred this quieter life, the growing tensions between the American colonies and Great Britain soon drew him back into public life.</p>

        <p>As conflicts with Britain escalated, Washington became a strong advocate for colonial resistance. In 1775, the Second Continental Congress appointed him Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, leading the colonies in their fight for independence. The Revolutionary War (1775-1783) was a long and difficult struggle, marked by hardships like the brutal winter at Valley Forge. Despite these challenges, Washington’s leadership held the army together, and his key victories—such as the surprise attack at Trenton in 1776 and the final victory at Yorktown in 1781—secured American independence.</p>

        <p>After the war, Washington hoped to retire to Mount Vernon, but his country needed him again. In 1787, he presided over the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where the U.S. Constitution was drafted. Washington’s advocacy for a strong federal government and his reputation for integrity made him a natural leader as the young nation sought stability.</p>
